UPDATE LOG

======= 2014-06-01 =======
Added textField to display property's longDescription

Future feature updates:
- Either dynamically size property cell to show all description items or tap the scroll view to enlarge in a modal view.
- Add images to property descriptions

Next steps:
- Figure out a way to display each shape's displayNames properly (HSS and PIPE are giving problems, because AISC is stupid with their raw data).
    - HSS Pipes do not have consistent number of decimal places
    - Pipes require special formatting
- Return managed objects to faults before dismissing view controllers (to prevent strong retention cycles)

======= 2014-05-31 =======
Finished implementing Properties VC
Created a subclass of TableViewCell for properties (AW_PropertyTableViewCell) with xib
Added methods to AW_Property to return formatted strings for display
Added groups (sections) to Property raw data
Added removal of target-action on unitSystem change when view disappears

Next steps:
- Figure out a way to display each shape's displayNames properly (HSS and PIPE are giving problems, because AISC is stupid with their raw data).
    - HSS Pipes do not have consistent number of decimal places
    - Pipes require special formatting
- Add behavior where selecting property cell causes it to become larger, showing the longDescription
- Return managed objects to faults before dismissing view controllers (to prevent strong retention cycles)

======= 2014-05-27 =======

Added some formatting for shape displayNames and group names
Partially implementd Properties VC

Next steps:
- Figure out a way to display each shape's displayNames properly (HSS and PIPE are giving problems, because AISC is stupid with their raw data).
    - HSS Pipes do not have consistent number of decimal places
    - Pipes require special formatting
- Complete implementation of Properties VC
    - Add groups (sections)
    - Format symbol
    - Display value in the correct format
    - Create custom cell to show long description
- Return managed objects to faults before dismissing view controllers (to prevent strong retention cycles)
- Figure out a better way to implement the flip animation and the isMetric stuff


======= 2014-05-26 =======

Implemented view controller for AW_Shapes
Added target-action to nav bar's unitSystem segmented control to show flip animation
Created AW_InfoBar view
Added group fields to AW_ShapeFamily and AW_Shape (updated import utility)

Next steps:
- Format display name for shapes to look nice (replace X with unicode x and spaces)
- Implement next view controller to show properties for selected shape


======= 2014-05-24 =======

Added shortName and longName fields to database entity.
Import Utility now implements transformation of UIColor to store in Core Data.
ShapeFamily VC uses colors and shortName from AW_Database for nav bar

Next steps:
- Implement the next table view controller for AW_Shapes


======= 2014-05-21 =======

Added navigation VC and shape family VC

Next steps:
- Adjust database model to add a "longName" and "shortName" property to the Databse entity
- Update the import utility to correctly transform a UIColor and store it with AW_Database
- Update this app to unpack the UIColor and use it in the correct locations
- Update the import utility such that the raw shape family import TSV has a column for which database that shape family belongs to
