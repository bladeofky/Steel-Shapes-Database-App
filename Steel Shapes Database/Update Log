UPDATE LOG

======= 2014-05-21 =======

Added navigation VC and shape family VC

Next steps:
- Adjust database model to add a "longName" and "shortName" property to the Databse entity
- Update the import utility to correctly transform a UIColor and store it with AW_Database
- Update this app to unpack the UIColor and use it in the correct locations
- Update the import utility such that the raw shape family import TSV has a column for which database that shape family belongs to

======= 2014-05-24 =======

Added shortName and longName fields to database entity.
Import Utility now implements transformation of UIColor to store in Core Data.
ShapeFamily VC uses colors and shortName from AW_Database for nav bar

Next steps:
- Implement the next table view controller for AW_Shapes
